# VR-internship-ATM
Development  of a VR  game, FPS like, in order to produce a shooting game that could be useful for the military training. The final goal is to produce a game thta can simulate different environments (wind, rain, light) and potentially produce a prototype gun that can send feedback to the user when shooting (wind, or the backward movement)
